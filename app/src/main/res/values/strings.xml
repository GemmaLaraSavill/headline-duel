    <string name="information_body">This app is powered by a fine-tuned DistilBERT model for news classification.\n\n
The model was originally trained as part of my Udacity Nanodegree project, using the AG News dataset, and then fine-tuned with LoRA adapters for efficiency.\n\n
To bring the project into the “real world,” I uploaded the model to Hugging Face and exposed it via an API. Headline Duel is the next step: an Android app where humans can classify news headlines and compare their answers against the model’s predictions.\n\n
This closes the loop between my work in machine learning and my core expertise in Android development — showing how AI can be tested, validated, and integrated into practical mobile experiences.</string>
